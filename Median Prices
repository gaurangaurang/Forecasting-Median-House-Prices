#Data Preprocessing. 
#The data set had median prices of one bedroom apartments 
#from various neighbourhoods in the US for the period between January 2010 to
#September 2016.
#For the purpose of this repository, I have considered only the median prices of
#houses in Upper East Side because it was the only neighbourhood with complete
#data available.
#I have tried to predict the median apartment price for the next 12 months using
#ARIMA model.
