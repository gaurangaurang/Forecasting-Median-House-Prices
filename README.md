# Forecasting-Median-House-Prices
I have built an ARIMA model to predict the median price of one bedroom apartments in Upper East Village for a period of 12 months. 
#The data set had median prices of one bedroom apartments from various neighbourhoods in the US for the period between January 2010 to September 2016. For the purpose of this repository, I have considered only the median prices of houses in Upper East Side because it was the only neighbourhood with complete data available.
I have tried to predict the median apartment price for the next 12 months using ARIMA model.
